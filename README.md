# Project Structure

/components        - All step components
/lib               - Utility functions (e.g. downloadMarkdown.js)
/public/data       - All game data (lineages, flaws, skills, gear, etc.)
/pages/index.js    - Step-based character creation flow

### Data Files

All game mechanics (flaws, gear, lineages, etc.) are stored in flat JSON files inside public/data/ to keep logic clean and editable.

# Export
Once complete, a character can be downloaded as a .md file using the "Download Markdown" button on the final step. The file is named after the character.
